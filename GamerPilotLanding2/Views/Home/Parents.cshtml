                <h3>We grow your children while they play</h3>
                <p class="block-txt">
                    In a digital world where children spend increasingly more time in front of the screen it is natural to question if they
                    are wasting their time and better off doing other activites. E-sport is the future community for children who gather around the game,
                    the competition, social intercourse and the healthy competetion. We believe e-sport is the key to activate and acknowledge a large group
                    of children who are often overlooked. Research in computergaming among youngsters has established a clear connection between reflective use of games
                    and an increased understanding of life skills such as problem solving, collaboration, linguistic skills and much more.

                <p class="block-txt">

                    Through pedagogical correct and impactful e-sports coaching by skilled and certified e-instructors we establish a strong foundation for
                    mental- and social health. All of our courses are based on a related life skill that we help the players evolve during their games hence
                    providing them with a solid skillset that can be used in real life as well.

                <p class="block-txt">
                    21st century skills comprise skills, abilities, and learning dispositions that have been identified as being required for success in 21st century society and workplaces by educators,
                    business leaders, academics, and governmental agencies. This is part of a growing international movement focusing on the skills
                    required for students to master in preparation for success in a rapidly changing, digital society. Many of these skills are also
                    associated with deeper learning, which is based on mastering skills such as analytic reasoning, complex problem solving, and teamwork.
                    These skills differ from traditional academic skills in that they are not primarily content knowledge-based

                    occur in a sequence, though backtracking and jumping around
                    among the phases often occurs. The Project Learning Bicycle

                    To ensure high quality across all of our courses they are structured of these four phases. The structure will make the basis for a solid
                    learning experience that maximizes learning output for all of our enrolled students. Lessons learned from going through the entire project cycle
                    can often be applied to the next project, or sometimes to a new iteration of the same problem domain, with the second time refining the
                    project definition, improving the plan, refining project implementation, and resulting in deeper reflections and reviews.
                    This way, learning grows and deepens.

                                (and not just a lecturer), learning activities must be designed so
                                that the students own much of the learning and teaching. Students’
                                planning their work, doing research, asking questions, designing procedures, taking
                                on leadership and group facilitation roles, analyzing their own
                                results, getting feedback from others, and so on are all important

                                It's common in our courses that the coach ends this phase with a small inspirational story intended to
